# IoT_Smart_Light

## Overview
The Smart Lighting Control System is an Internet of Things(IoT) project designed to provide intelligent control and monitoring of lighting systems within a building. By automating lighting control based on various factors, such as motion detection and ambient illumination levels, the project aims to enhance energy efficiency, user comfort, and convenience.

The core component, a Controller (Arduino), orchestrates sensor data and controls the actuators responsible for the lighting. Users can interact with the system via a Telegrambot, enabling remote light control and status checks.
A JSON configuration simplifies setup, and the system allows room-level lighting control.

## Objectives
##### + Objective 1:
Implement an energy-efficient lighting control system. Promote sustainable energy use and reduce waste.
##### + Objective 2:
Provide user-selectable automatic and manual lighting modes. Enable remote control and monitoring of the lighting system.
##### + Objective 3:
Adjust lighting status based on ambient light conditions. Enhance user comfort and atmosphere through smart lighting.
